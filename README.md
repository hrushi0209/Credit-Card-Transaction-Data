Overview:- 

This project involves a detailed exploratory data analysis (EDA) of a credit card transaction dataset, aimed at uncovering patterns, detecting outliers, and identifying potential fraud. The project demonstrates the application of various data analysis techniques, including univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis, as well as time series analysis and fraud detection.

Introduction:- 

The primary objective of this project is to analyze credit card transaction data to gain insights into customer behavior, transaction trends, and potential fraudulent activities. This analysis is intended to support data-driven decision-making in areas such as marketing, fraud prevention, and customer relationship management.

Analysis and Methodology

The project follows a structured approach to data analysis:-

Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, merging columns, and converting data types.
Univariate Analysis: Analyzing individual features to understand their distribution and identify outliers.
Bivariate and Multivariate Analysis: Examining relationships between features to uncover patterns and correlations.
Time Series Analysis: Analyzing transaction data over time to identify trends and patterns.
Fraud Detection: Identifying outliers and patterns indicative of potential fraud.

Key Findings:-
Significant outliers were identified in transaction amounts, highlighting potential high-value transactions and fraud risks.
No significant differences were found in transaction amounts across genders.
Correlation analysis revealed weak relationships between transaction amounts and population size, indicating that high-value transactions are not necessarily associated with more populous areas.
Time series analysis suggested periodic peaks in transaction volumes, which could be aligned with specific times or events.

Conclusion:-

This project provides valuable insights into credit card transaction patterns, highlighting key areas for further investigation and action, particularly in fraud detection and customer segmentation.
